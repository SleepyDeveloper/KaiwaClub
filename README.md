KaiwaClub
=========

A simple rails app to manage attendance of the Japanese/English language
exchange group that I run in Little Tokyo every other Monday. It also provides
a few reports using chart.js such as the ratio of Japanese and English speakers
in attendance.

TODO
====

* Single admin user sign on (devise).
* Landing and static pages that promote Little Tokyo Kaiwa Club when not logged in as admin.
* Reports, average Japanese/non-Japanese attendance, etc.
* add slugs for routing. (ex. /admin/meetups/2017-01-06 instead of /admin/meetups/:id)
